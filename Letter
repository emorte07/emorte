Dear Maâ€™am Luningning,

I am writing to express my interest to apply for the position of Information Officer I at National Academy Science and Technology with plantilla item number 2022-29-TF-ADV-IO1. I saw this job vacancy on NAST website. I was truly elated to know about this opportunity, and I am humbled if you consider me as one of the candidates. I believe that my skills in designing, photo and video editing, analytical and evaluation, sense of leadership, responsibility, and accountability make me an excellent fit for this career.

In my current position as a technician or a leader in Western Digital, I spearheaded several achievements in my department. My team with my aptitude for handling responsibilities and practicing safety procedures for my workers helped to get these achievements such as finished activities before the due date, and saving data systematically and orderly.

I would like to convey my commitment to public service and promoting general welfare. I see great potential in presentation, data keeping, management, leadership, and service. I have Career Service Professional Certificate from Civil Service Commission. I will use this certificate as an eligibility to apply.

I have greatly enjoyed working in Western Digital, yet I feel that I am ready for a new challenge and am intrigued by the opportunity to help National Academy Science and Technology with their activities. Please see my documents and personal website on https://emorte07.github.io/morte.github.io/ to know more about me. I look forward to meeting with you soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
